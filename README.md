Provision Phase:  In this initial phase, the algorithm establishes a set of candidate nodes for each city based on their distances. It classifies the TSP problem into two types based on the distribution of pairwise distances between nodes: Type I (single peak distribution) and Type II (two peaks distribution). For each city, it identifies "Circle-Layer" node sets, which categorize nearby nodes into layers based on their distance. The algorithm also defines "Remaining" and "Candidate" node sets to facilitate the selection of the next city to visit. This prioritization aims to reduce total travel distance by focusing on closer nodes first.

Shot Gun  Phase: This phase involves generating a large number of candidate routes (e.g. 3N2  ). Each route is constructed by randomly selecting an initial city and then iteratively choosing subsequent cities from the candidate set. The selection process uses a probability function that considers both the distance to candidate nodes and a distance adjustment coefficient, ensuring that closer cities have a higher chance of being chosen. The algorithm also includes a "finetuning" process when only a few nodes remain unvisited, optimizing their visiting order.
After generating all routes, the algorithm retains the  3N   shortest routes for further processing.


Fuzzy Concatenate Phase: In this phase, the algorithm refines its route selection by generating additional routes (e.g. 200N ) using weighted probabilities based on previous route performance. The weights are derived from how frequently pairs of nodes have been visited together in prior iterations, allowing the algorithm to learn from past routes and improve future selections. The number of retained routes decreases over time according to a specified attenuation rate, ensuring that only the most promising routes are kept.
The algorithm also employs different counting modes to manage node pair occurrences effectively, switching modes based on whether improvements are observed in consecutive iterations. If no improvements are detected after a set number of iterations T, the algorithm terminates.
